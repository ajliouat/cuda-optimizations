## Installation

### Prerequisites
- CUDA Toolkit 11.7+
- PyTorch 2.0+ with CUDA support
- CMake 3.14+

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Build CUDA Kernels
```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

---

## Usage

### Run Benchmarks
```bash
./scripts/run_benchmarks.sh
```

### Use CUDA Kernels in Python
```python
from src.python.cuda_ops import attention, reduction

# Example usage
output = attention(query, key, value)
result = reduction(input_tensor)
```
